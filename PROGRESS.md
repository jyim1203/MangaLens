# MangaLens — Build Progress

One paragraph per completed phase: what got built, what interfaces changed,
what's deferred.

## Phase 0 summary

Scaffolded the full dev loop: Vite + `@samrum/vite-plugin-web-extension`
building a Firefox MV3 extension (event page via `background.scripts` — the
plugin emits `background.html`; never switch to `service_worker`), strict
TypeScript, ESLint (flat config) + Prettier, Vitest with 6 passing unit tests,
and `web-ext lint` at 0 errors / 0 warnings. All four entry points are wired
and verified end-to-end: content script and popup both ping the background over
`runtime.sendMessage`. First shared modules landed: `shared/constants.ts`
(including `PROMPT_VERSION`, reserved for the cache key per gap resolution #4)
and `shared/log.ts` (scoped leveled logger, warn-threshold in prod builds).
Interface notes for later phases: `strict_min_version` had to be bumped to
**128.0** because `optional_host_permissions` requires it; the content script
is injected on `<all_urls>` but inert-by-default (gap resolution #7); in-flight
jobs will deliberately not persist across event-page unloads (gap resolution
#8). Deferred: everything functional — Phase 1 starts with drafting the full
`Settings` interface and typed message contracts (gap resolutions #5/#6),
adding `kind?: RegionKind` to `TranslatedRegion` (gap #2). Also deferred to
Phase 8: web-ext's informational notice recommending the (Nightly-only)
`data_collection_permissions` manifest key.
